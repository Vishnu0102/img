Understanding No sql Db - Hbase 
RdBMS - relational database managemanet system 
Mysql, sqlitr , postgrsql  

challenges faced by traditional Rdbms ;
Join operation on high volume of data is very much complicated 
transaction support -
mainatinting  high volume of data and velocity  of data 
cost of Rdbms -> mainataince of rdbms is high due to they coukdnt run on commobidty hardware 
High latency faced when dealing with high velocity of data (like performing some queries on data )
NOSQL   -> Not only sql databases 
Features of NoSql DB 
Flexible schema No need to declare any schema 
we can just insert the data on the fly 

2. Support for multiple data models 
No sql database can support all the 3 varients of data ,
structured data , semi structured data ..json,xml,unstructured.image ,video ,audio 

3.scalabilty 
in rdbms ..only we do vertical scalling , if u do horizonatla consistency will be problem 
with peer to peer architecture the nosql databaase are easily scaleable .
Shading also helps in no sql database

Distributed capability - No sql databases can be sitributed on a world wide scale follow cluster concept 



Mongodb
Is a document type data type json.. ,
the structre of data that changes .. 
casandra has is not consistent cap theorem 







Replication means replica ..lik e if th e dta ta chnages the replica shd alao change 
duplication means the data will not chnages in other machine 
consistency ..either complete or not 
time buffering between the transaction .. (eventulally consistent or soft state 

Base => Basic availabilty 
soft state
eventulally consistent
hbase  cassandr a mongodb 
it doesnt follow acid |base

in graph ..node is where we rae defining some relation 


no schema , supports dynamic , replicarion shading , indexing 
no joins , 

spark airflow sql hdfs hive ,nosql db .. bit of cloud

col.inserted_id is where we are inserting the id 

collection.insert_many()
find
for..

{"GRE Score":{"$gt":337}}  -- filter gretaer than 337















kafka zookeeper ... cluster coordinator

kafka has embedded zookeeper (works on single node) metadata is stored in zookeper as an offset 

emr is elastic map reduce 
fully managed entrapise cluster  for big data 
appache apRK , GADDOp is like venila la

entrweprise service providers , cloera, autgonox , emr , 

EMR

log into console.aws.amaozn 
inside data analytics we have emr 
create a cluster go to advsnce option 


go to ec2 key pair 
create new key pair  file format is ppk putty 

download putty and keep and provide key pair file in auth
