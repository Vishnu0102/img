
during tradition software systems , 
we had machines , servers , network , databases , 
To host or execute any application /program , we need the infrastcture and supportive services.

rdbms , mysql , oracle ,... thes are the applications hepls to maipula6te the date 
in traditional way .. infrastructure (physical /servers)
(cost was high and security was low)
Application
Disadvantage of traditional deevelopment .
(Manual setup , Physical machine maintaince ,cost is high , security flaws are high )

cloud : a remote location or a remote agent which will provide  all the necessary services to build /host /mainatin the application
Ex : to build and web app we need machines , dabase service 

why c;oud , maninatce is quick , cost is cheap , security is good

types of aws services
Computing service 
ec2 (elastic cloud compute ), lambda (serverless service )
Storage 
S3 (simple storage service )

database services
aws rds

storage s3 simple storage service 
data services  aws rds (relational database service )
aws athena (serverless db)
No sql databasee... aws dynamo (key value )

data warehouing redshift 
analytics emr (elastic map reduce )
glue (distributed )
kinesis (for sptreamnng data )
sqs (simple queee service )

everything that u keep in bucket is cakled object 










AWS 2 :
ec2 is a on demand infra 

aws lambda:
lightweighted serverless service 
no infra setup is needed 
ex: API develpoment
every request has a particular function 
the https request is used to know about the function required to 

the request are mapped to ufunction 
lambda works on triggers 
you provide the triggers while test ., 
create a script , deply it , then tests it 
cloud watch where logs are stored 

S3 bucket 

i am to restrict servcice  access 
when 2 services in the aws 
AWS A/C 
I AM user ->differnt logins for eacj users 
I am Role -> contains polices to acces aws resources 

boto3 libarary in python 
bucket stores data in the form of object , then key to identiffy them 

on configure -permission-

add permision- amazons3full access

role that is created -permision-createinline policy  -s3-

attach then inline policy -s3-resource ..arn 

bucket-prop-event notifications- event type..after u upload data fil e on 
after u upload data  the cloud watch will have log of metadata  as we print eventr
